Q1: It was removed becasue the label was no longer necessary. It was good style to remove it.

Q2: I am not sure how language settings work with coreutils or *Nix systems in general, but 
	unless the date format is translated to the users langaue somehow the new ls format will 
	be incomprehensible, mainly due to the month abbreviations.
	
Q3: It returned a stack trace and an error detailed below
OUTPUT:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

problem in module -> problem in main -> problem in call to generator.chooseline() 
-> problem in return random.choice(self.lines)

I went to /usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py opened the file and found that this specific error is set to be raised if
"seq is empty" which it was because we purposefully passed in an emty file, "null"

Q4:
Running with with python3 it outputs get a sytax error, this is becasue in python3 you cannot read an exception in that format, as a tuple. 
And when we pass in an empty file we raise this exception causing the invalid syntax to trigger.
OUTPUT:
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
