Exercise 1.5
Ansers:
4. first I didnt have execute permissions for my own program so I had to use chmod to give myself execute premission.
	Next I tried to run it multiple times but even with a successful compilation (and the program seemed to macth the online perfectly) I was gettign strange.
	OUTPUT: ./hello.c:2: int: commnad not found
		./hello.c:3: sytax error near unexpected token `void'
		./hello.c:3: `main (void)'
	(I know this means I meade a mistake. I just could not seem to correct it)

Keystrokes: 
1. M-x m a k e - d i r e c t o r y ENTER J u n k ENTER
2. C-x C-f j u n k / h e l l o . c ENTER (copy code from assignment)
3. M-x c o m p i l e ENTER C-a C-k g c c SP h e l l o . c SP - o SP h e l l o enter
4. M-x s h e l l ENTER . / h e l l o . c ENTER c h m o d u + r w x ENTER . / h e l l o . c ENTER
5. C-s C-p(# of times) C-b(# of times) M-w M-x b ENTER C-> C-y

Exercise 1.6
Answers: 
4. -1515958523494876401, this number is negative while both "random" numbers were positive. Thus it must be incorrect, caused by some sort of memeory error im guessing.
5. It returns the same inccorrect number followed by two other numbers seperated by a comma, one with a leading #x another with a leading #o.
6. no, a computer cannot account for infinity but a truely random number generator would have -infinity to infinity as its set of numbers to pick from.
7. Almost 100%. The number of integer pairs which when multiplied give a correct answer is always going to be a finite set becasue of memory constraints within the programs/computers we are all using. Additionally the number of interger pairs which will give errors (given the numbers picked are truely random) will be near infinite. So when we compare an infinte set compared to a finite set we will alomost always be in the infinite set, so near 100% of the time we will have an incorrect product.
