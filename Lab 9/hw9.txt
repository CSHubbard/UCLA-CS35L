homework 9

cd week9/homework/
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git
cd diffutils
git checkout v3.0 -b quote
git status
-Check out version 3.0 of Diffutils and check to make sure it was checked out into branch quote

 patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt
 -install the patch
 
 git status
 -check if the patch was applied to the 6 files as expected, and get their names
 
emacs src/cmp.c
emacs src/diff.c
emacs src/diff3.c
emacs src/dir.c
emacs src/sdiff.c
emacs src/util.c
-for each of these files added them to the changlog file and wrote an appropriate message using emacs.

git commit -a -F src/ChangeLog
-commit the changes made to the repository using :ChangeLog" as the commit message
-the -a option specifies that we want to commit all files that have been changed that git 
	already knows about and the -F option specifies that we want a file as the commit message
	followed by the file itself.
	
NOTE: I did not have a partner for this part so i just checked out version 3.0 again into a new temporary branch "test",
		and followed the proceeding steps.
		
git am < formatted-patch.txt
-apply the patch

export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check
-checks to make sure the patch works as intended, make check has a few errors which i beleive are okay

make distdir
